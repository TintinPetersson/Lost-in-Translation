- We created a React application that translates words to english sign language images. As the second project at Experis Academy. 

## Features include:

- Login function, using "username" without password. Only able to use the app when signed in. Includes user-login validation.

- Responsive and simple user interface.

- The translation page. Where you input english words and it returns pictures of the english sign language back to the user.

- A profile page for the user to view previous translations. Also able to delete the translation history for that user.

- Lastly includes a simple logout function which returns the user to the login page.


Libraries and "techniques" used: Bootstrap, simple-typewriter, context api.



Enjoy! :)
